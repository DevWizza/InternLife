    A lot of overachievers develop perfectionist tendencies at a young age when demands on their time are limited to school,
    hobbies and maybe an after-school job. It’s easier to maintain that perfectionist habit as a kid, but as you grow up,
    life gets more complicated. As you climb the ladder at work and as your family grows, your responsibilities mushroom.
    Perfectionism becomes out of reach, and if that habit is left unchecked, it can become destructive, says executive coach
    Marilyn Puder-York, PhD, who wrote <a href="#"> The Office Survival Guide.</a>

    The key to avoid burning out is to let go of perfectionism, says Puder-York. “As life gets more expanded it’s very hard,
    both neurologically and psychologically, to keep that habit of perfection going,” she says, adding that the healthier
    option is to strive not for perfection, but for excellence.

    From telecommuting to programs that make work easier, technology has helped our lives in many ways. But it has also created
    expectations of constant accessibility. The work day never seems to end. “There are times when you should just shut your
    phone off and enjoy the moment,” says Robert Brooks.
