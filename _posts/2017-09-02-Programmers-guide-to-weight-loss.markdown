description: As a software developer I know the pain of trying to stay healthy when our schedules tend to be pretty tight. This post is not the usual how-to guide, here I want to spend some time talking about the importance of staying healthy and how to implement a diet that will boost brain power and burn fat without having to put lots of effort.

## It all started back in the 70s

In the 1970s the president George McGovern commission concluded that high amounts of fat in the diet contributed to heart disease. Food companies and Americans responded by cutting fat in the products that were produced and the food that was eaten.

But something very interesting happened... [SUGAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S6-v37nOtY). Reduced fat meant reduced flavor, so the food industry substituted with [High Fructose Corn Syrup](http://drhyman.com/blog/2011/05/13/5-reasons-high-fructose-corn-syrup-will-kill-you/) for flavor. Americans consume an enormous amount of sugar sodas, energy drinks, various fruit drinks and fruit juices that are carb and sugar nightmares.

## If sugar is that bad, why is it everywhere?

The answer to that is I don't know... Even myself I don't understand how this got so out of control. This is a very political topic and there's so much money involved and not so much we can do beside educating ourself to take care of our health and not letting those big organizations ruin it without our consent.

Many people aren't aware about the fact that the production of food high in sugar is actually cheaper for food processors, and the more sugar they add to their food the more addictive it is for the consumer, so it's a win-win for them.

## Let's find the root cause

Many people assume that it's a matter of eating less and moving more and that you will lose a pound of fat per week if you substract 500 calories to your daily intake. But... that doesn't work that way!

Like everything else in life there's alway a root cause to pretty much anything (at least in planet earth) and weight gain can occur from so many things that are not necessarily dietary.

So let's go through each section and as you read all of this I want you to think about what happened or what did you do during that time you started gaining all the weight.

## 1. Are you healthy?

To lose weight you need to be healthy first, I know it sounds contradictory to what everyone is saying but the reason why I say this is because being overweight is a symptom, not a disease as some people insist.

These are situations that can cause weight gain faster than food:

1. Divorce (Emotional stress).
2. Surgery (Physical stress).
3. Not sleeping well (Physical stress).
4. Deficient in certain nutrients and vitamins (Metabolism can't work properly).
5. Eating too frequently [A.K.A 6 small meals](https://lifespa.com/dangers-of-frequent-eating/) (Physical Stress, specially if it causes you bloating).
6. Infections. (Physical stress)
7. Constant pain in some area of the body (Physical stress).

Stress is a huge factor in this and going through stress for a long period of time can turn into chronic stress which can lead to:

1. High blood pressure.
2. Low sex drive.
3. Risk for heart attack.
4. Depression.
5. Fertility problems.
6. Missed periods for women.
7. Tense muscle.
8. Weakened immune system.
9. Pounding heart.
10. High blood sugar. (Which can then turn into type 2 diabetis)

My point here is that before blaming it all on the food we eat what we actually need to do is a step back and dig deeper to find what's really causing the weight gain because I know of people who have their diet on point yet they are still overweight because of stress.

## 2. Do you focus solely on calories?

Focusing solely on calories has been the traditional way for losing weight fed to us by the media and these so called ["fitness experts"](https://www.everydayhealth.com/weight/how-to-achieve-one-pound-of-weight-loss.aspx).

Every time you try the "Eat less and move more" rule what's gonna happen is your metabolism is gonna decrease in order to protect itself. 

The body is pretty smart when it comes to making decisions to help you stay alive, anything that threathen your survival will makes your metabolism "fight back" and it does that by slowing itself down thus not letting you lose any weight at all.

So my recommendation for you is instead of restricting calories, focus more on the quality of food you are eating. Remove any type of sugar from the diet along with processed food and that alone will help you shred some stubborn fat.

Here is a book I found to be actually very helpful in which the author highly recommends avoiding the consumption of sugar for serious weight loss and making that your diet. [SOS (Stop Only Sugar) Diet: You Won't Even Know You're On A Diet!](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982560184/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

For some people stopping the consumption of sugar overnight can be hard and I understand that because I was there too and it has to do with your body expecting sugar because it's what it's used to, one thing you can do to go past that phase very fast is replace those foods with pleasure foods that kinda mimic the taste of sugar. Here is a link with very good recipes you can try with your family! [Dr. Berg Low-Carb recipes.](https://www.drberg.com/blog/category/recipes)

## 3. Do you eat frequently?

We've been told for a long time that eating small meals throughout the day can boost our metabolism thus increasing thermogenesis.  There are many studies disputing this notion. In 1997, the British Journal of Medicine did a thorough review of all such related studies, and found no evidence that eating 6 meals a day increases metabolism, thermogenesis, or weight loss.

<b>Most fat burning hormones act in the abscense of Insulin, and every time you eat regardless of what you eat your digestive system signals the pancreas to produce Insulin thus blocking fat burning temporarily.</b>

So the less frequent you eat, the less Insulin your pancreas has to create thus letting your body burn fat once the absorption of nutrients is done (and most of your glycogen stores has been used for energy).

Eating three meals a day and not snacking in between meals is a great step forward. You could do two meals a day and be fine, the point being done here is, make sure you are eating at least two to three times a day <b>(not more than that)</b> and as much calories as your body needs and that you aren't starving yourself of calories.

Add healthy fats to your meals so you can go longer without eating and feeling hungry, the less dietary fat you eat the harder it will be for you to go longer without food.

## 4. Are you consuming enough healthy fats?

One of the reason why consuming fat can actually help you burn fat has to do with the fact that fat itself has the least impact on insulin. [Watch this TED video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da1vvigy5tQ) for more information with this regard.

But be careful with what type of fat and where that fat comes from, by healthy fats I mean very safe sources like:

1. Avocado
2. Cheese
3. Whole eggs
4. Nuts
5. Coconut oil
6. Organic Peanut Butter

But... let's step back for a moment and think about that we discussed earlier. Remember when in the 70s people started substituting fats with sugar and then the obesity epidemic began? That's because our bodies need fat and excluding it from the diet can actually cause weight gain and more problems.

Here is an article explaining the importance of fat in our diets, and why going low-fat can be harmful to your health. [Dr. Axe 7 Low-Fat Diet Risks You Need to Know About!](https://draxe.com/low-fat-diet-risks/)

So say no-no to <b>low-fat</b> products because <b>"low-fat"</b> is code word for <b>high in sugar</b>. And if you don't believe me, when you go to the store buy some low-fat product and read the back label where it says the sugar and you will be surprised.

## 5. Are you consuming processed foods?

Processed foods are loaded with chemicals that can do more harm than good, and all they do is trick us into thinking that the food taste better when most of the time it actually doesn't.

Most processed foods are way too high in sugar and that's another reason to avoid them, and not any type of sugar but [High-fructose corn syrup.](http://drhyman.com/blog/2011/05/13/5-reasons-high-fructose-corn-syrup-will-kill-you/) which can cause:

1. Leaky Gut.
2. Diabetis type 2 (By the aggresive increase of the production of Insulin).
3. Inflammation in different areas of the body.
4. Heart Diseases.
5. Cancer.
6. Age faster.
7. Acne or aggravate it.
8. Damage your teeth.
9. Serious spike in Insulin.
10. They turn into fat very very very very very very very fast.
11. Increases LDL and decreases HDL.
12. Raise cholesterol levels.

And more importantly, processed food is most of the time just empty calories and that alone is a big indicator that you should not consume them.

What really puts the metabolism on fire is nutrient-dense foods, not just calories. Eating 1800 calories from vegetable will speed up your metabolism way more than eating 3000 empty calories from pasta.

## Now putting science aside let's put all that information into practice!

When my sister and I started our weight loss journey, we were lost by the vast amount of information available in internet. We didn't know what to do or who to follow for advice, until one day I remember coming across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwCRjwDs1Ek&t=) where there's a Dr. explaining how Intermittent Fasting can be the ultimate tool for weight loss and health!

Wait... I know it sounds cliche but hear me out before rolling eyes...

Intermittent Fasting is not a diet itself but more of a tool you can use for health benefits that go way beyond weight loss such as:

1. <b>Increases</b> Insulin sensitivity.
2. <b>Increases</b> Leptin sensitivity.
3. <b>Increases</b> Gherlin hormone thus less likely to overeat.
4. <b>Decreases</b> Inflammation and free radical damage.
5. <b>Decreases</b> metabolic disease risk.
6. <b>Decreases</b> the risk of chronic disease from diabetis to cancer.
7. <b>Makes you</b> become "Fat adapted" which means your body will use your own stored fat more frequently for fuel.

<b>Oh cool! that's all great, but how is it done?</b>

Basically to intermittently fast all you have to do is choose an eating window you feel comfortable with and then eat all you want within that limited window and after that, don't eat or drink anything beside just water until your next eating window <b>the next day</b>.

Many people confuse Intermittent Fasting with [Very Low Calorie Diets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGcXTGWzaY) but they are completely two separate things. When people go on VLCD diets they end up hurting their metabolism because they are restricting calories and your body doesn't like that because it's a threat to your survival.

On the other hand Intermittent Fasting is not about restricting calories, it's about smaller eating windows thus less Insulin spikes and letting your digestive system rest and do its work absorbing nutrients.

Also I want to point out that just because you can get away with certain type of food doing Intermittent Fasting that doesn't mean you should be doing unhealthy choices of food, remember that sugar is not your best friend when it comes to losing weight and if you want to specifically tap your fat stores for energy more frequently then you should opt for eating vegetables, complete protein and healthy fats in your eating window.

<b>Can I have an example I can follow?</b>

Sure, I will use myself as an example and here is how my days are usually laid out:

## ==============================

<b>Morning</b>

<b>7:00 AM.</b> I wake up.

<b>8:00 AM.</b> I sit on my laptop.

<b>9:00 AM.</b> I eat my first meal consisting of lots of [cruciferous vegetable](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cruciferous-vegetables-fact-sheet), complete protein such as boiled eggs and healthy fats e.g avocado or nuts. Probably about 1200 calories in one sitting.

## ==============================

<b>Afternoon</b>

<b>1:00 PM.</b> I eat my second meal which is about 1,200 calories too.

And then after that I don't eat anything until the next day. No snacks, no 5 calories food, no 2 calories gum. Absolutely nothing, just plain water.

## ==============================

<b>Evening</b>

I make oxygen my snack during these hours.

## ==============================

That's pretty much the schedule I follow every single day even in the weekends, and by the way the reason why I eat my first meal in the morning is because I find it easier to implement Intermittent Fasting that way, for some people they perform better eating their first meal in the afternoon or even at night which is weird in my opinion.

So to summarize everything I've said:

1. Avoid sugar like the plague.
2. Don't do six small meals.
3. Eat two to three meals a day.
4. Go high in vegetables.
5. Don't focus solely on calories.
6. Avoid processed foods.
7. No-no to low-fat products.
8. Reduce stress.
9. Intermittent Fasting is the best way to shred fat easily without having to count calories.
10. Include more healthy fats in your diet.

Here are some before and after pictures of me and my sister after going Low Sugar and Intermittent Fasting. :)
